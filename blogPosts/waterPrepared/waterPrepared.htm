<h1 style="text-align:center">How To Create a Simple Off Grid Water Backup System </h1>

<p> I did for an off grid situation. The system works well without pumps. I took advantage of the laws of physics and the siphon effect. 
  I used 2 55 galon tanks, pipes, floater shutoff for when filling up the tanks, and one direction valves.  </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Tanks</h1>

<p> I used 2 55 galon tanks from water prepared. </p>


<h1 style="text-align:center">Siphon Effect</h1>

<p> To avoid pumps, I took advantage of the siphon effect. The height if the tanks was not that much. 
  It was about 8 feet from the ground and about 4 feet from he height of all the faucets. </p>

<p>It is a good way to structure your story and many episodes of Rick and Morty were written in this way. </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Float ball valves.</h1>

<p>I used float ball valves to shutt off the water when the tanks were getting full. This is what I used:

<h3>Software and Hardware</h3>
<p>The software I use is called TVpaint. It is for 2D animation. I really like it.
	The hardware I use is a wacom tablet and it is the best I have found for digital hand drawing. There are different sizes. What you get will depend on your budget.  </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Publishing</h1>

<p> This assumes you want to self publish with Amazon. Their service is called KDP. You can just google Amazon KDP. 
	Here are some recommendations when publishing with Amazon: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Children's books are not long so you can start with about 40 panels. </li>
	<li>Choose the right name for your book</li>
	<li>Choose the right key words for your book</li>
	<li>You will need to budget to advertise on amazon (amazon ads)</li>
	<li>Submit your work to competitions and forums</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Merch</h1>

<p> When you draw, keep the backgrounds in a different layer. That way you can use your illustrations without background for your merchandise. 
	Amazon Merch is a part of amazon you can use to make and sell merchandise. See an example below.  </p>
